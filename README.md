# hand_written_digit_recognition
 Handwritten digits is the basic problem of the machine learning and can be solved in many ways here we will implement them by using TensorFlow.
 Using TensorFlow, an open-source Python library developed by the Google Brain labs for deep learning research, we will take hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9
 and build and train a neural network to recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.
