# hand_written_digit_recognition
One of the most powerful and most popular libraries for machine learning out there is Tensorflow.
It allows us to easily build, train and use neural networks. In this, we are going to use Tensorflow,
in order to recognize handwritten digits by training a deep neural network.

# Prerequisites
For this, we will need to import a couple of libraries.
If you are only interested in the training and testing of the model, you will only have to import Tensorflow.
However, if you also want to read in your own handwritings, you will need to import a couple more libraries.
Almost all of these libraries are external and need to be installed with some tool like pip.
